# Calibration

Data from UUCON measurement sites with a Licor 6262 or Licor 7000 on-site are calibrated every 2 h using the three reference gases, while sites with a LGR UGGA are calibrated every 3 h. Since the Li-6262s are near linear through the range of atmospheric observations and calibration gases, each standard of known mole fraction is linearly interpolated between two consecutive calibration periods to represent the drift in the measured standards over time. Ordinary least squares regression is then applied to the interpolated reference values, and the linear coefficients are used to correct the observations. The linear slope, intercept, and fit statistics are returned for each observation for diagnostic purposes. See [Bares et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-1291-2019) for more details.

## Gas Identification

To differentiate data between atmospheric air and reference gas measurements, we use the following `ID` convention:
| ID  | Description                                                |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| â‰¥0  | Reference gas measurement -- value indicates concentration |
| -10 | Atmospheric air measurement                                |
| -99 | System flush                                               |
